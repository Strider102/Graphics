	a. The theme is internet memes. <br />
	b. We plan on one main room now with potential to expand. <br />
	c. No ideas on floor and wall textures yet, but nothing that detracts too much from the art. <br />
	d. For now we are planning on having a ceiling, but depending on how lighting works out, we might change that. <br />
	e. For our sculpture, we will use Ugandan Knuckles. We should be able to find models online, but the character isn't too detailed so we could potentially do it on our own. <br />
	f. For the paintings, we will have some greatest hits of memes. These will be just like paintings hung on the wall with frames around them.
